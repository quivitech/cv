# **Simulation studies of an industrial robot using ROS and Gazebo.**  

Looked into the basic working of ROS(Robot Operating System). Have explored and executed examples of most of those concepts using the turtlesim simulator. Also able to know how robots can be made more feasible in industries to increase the output with less input. Our group also worked on how to synchronies the motors, using micro-processor.
